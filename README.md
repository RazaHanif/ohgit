**OhGit** - Git Bot for Auto-Commits
====================================

**OhGit** is an NPM package that watches your files and automatically commits changes in your Git repository when you forget after a certain period of inactivity. 
It's perfect for those who forget to commit their work regularly.

---

### Features:
- **Watchman**: Watches file changes in the currect directory
- **Commit Bot**: Automatically commits changes with a customizable commit message after a period of inactivity.
- **Message Maker**: Set your own commit message for the auto-commits.
- **Time Keeper**: Set the delay (in minutes) before the auto-commit happens.
- **Back to Basics**: Reset settings to default values.
- **Cross Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

---

### Installation:

1. Install the package globally using npm:

   ```
   npm install -g ohgit
   ```

2. Alternatively, you can install it locally within your project:

   ```
   npm install ohgit
   ```

---

### Usage:

After installation, you can use **OhGit** in your Git repository by running the following command:

```
ohgit
```

This command will start watching for file changes. After the default delay of 2 minutes of inactivity, **OhGit** will automatically commit changes to the repository with the default commit message.

---

### Defaults:

- Default commit message: "OhGit Auto-Commit"
- Default commit delay: 2 Minutes

---

### CLI Options:

**OhGit** supports the following command-line options:

- **`-m` or `--set-message`**  
  Set a custom commit message for auto-commits.  
  Example:
  ```
  ohgit -m "Custom Commit Message"
  ```

- **`-d` or `--set-delay`**  
  Set the inactivity delay before an auto-commit happens (in minutes).  
  Example:
  ```
  ohgit -d 5
  ```

- **`--reset`**  
  Reset **OhGit** settings to their default values. This removes the custom commit message and delay, restoring the default behavior.  
  Example:
  ```
  ohgit --reset
  ```

---

### Examples:

1. **Setting a custom commit message**:
   ```
   ohgit -m "Work on bug fixes"
   ```

2. **Setting the commit delay to 10 minutes**:
   ```
   ohgit -d 10
   ```

3. **Resetting **OhGit** settings to defaults**:
   ```
   ohgit --reset
   ```
